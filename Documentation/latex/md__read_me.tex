The goal of this school project was to understand how a FEM solver works. To do this, I coded a FEM library from scratch in C, guided by my teacher and inspired by the architecture of the IRMAR laboratory\textquotesingle{}s FEM library.\hypertarget{md__read_me_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Documentation}{Documentation}}\label{md__read_me_autotoc_md1}
This project is divided into several modules to handle every steps needed to solve a physical problem with a Finite Element Method. \href{https://jeanpousset.github.io/FEM-library/Documentation/html/files.html}{\texttt{ Full documentation is available here}} (created with doxygen).\hypertarget{md__read_me_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{License}{License}}\label{md__read_me_autotoc_md2}
